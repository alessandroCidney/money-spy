# MoneySpy

MoneySpy is a Nuxt.js/Vue.js website where you can log and monitor your expenses. It offers a great dashboard, an expense tracking interface, an achievements system, profile settings, authentication, and more.

## Live Website
You can access the website at <https://www.moneyspy.com.br>

## How to Run the Website

### Firebase Project Creation
This site uses Firebase. Therefore, to run it properly, you'll need a Firebase project. You can create one in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com).

After creating your project, run the commands below to create the Firebase configuration files according to your preferences.

```bash
firebase login

firebase init
```

This project already has some configuration files that were used to deploy it to our environment, but they probably won't be useful to you.

Once you've completed all of your project configuration, run the Firebase's deploy command to apply it to your environment:

```bash
firebase deploy # or npm run deploy
```

### Package Installation
Make sure to install the dependencies using **npm** or an equivalent package manager.

> Note: This project was created with npm and includes a package-lock.json file. <br> If you prefer to use a different package manager, remove the package-lock.json file before running the install command.

To install the dependencies using npm, run the command:
```bash
npm install
```

### Environment Variables
After that, create a **.env** file and set up the environment variables as specified in the **.env.example** file.

### Run on Localhost
Finally, to run the project at http://localhost:3000, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```
